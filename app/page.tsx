          <p className={classNames.home33}>
            After encountering numerous &ldquo;rank predictors&rdquo; on the
            internet that ask for your marks along with personal data like your
            phone number and name—only to farm and sell this information, as
            well as &ldquo;coaches&rdquo; and &ldquo;bhaiyas&rdquo; on Youtube
            spreading misinformation - we felt frustrated. Students lacked a
            legitimate way to predict and calculate their ranks. This
            frustration led to the creation of RankPredictor, a website that
            allows you to predict your rank for various exams with no nonsense.

          <p className={classNames.home33}>
            We gather verified and accurate data from past exam results to
            ensure our predictions are reliable. Using various mathematical
            methods, such as polynomial regression, we aim to provide the most
            accurate rank predictions possible. Detailed explanations of our
            rank prediction process for each exam are available in the
            &ldquo;How does this work?&rdquo; section within each exam&rsquo;s
            predictor, complete with graphs and datasets for transparency and
            scrutiny.
